long-description = """

EWS is a web server construction kit, designed for embedded
applications using the GNAT Ada compiler.

The project is hosted at https://github.com/simonjwright/ews.

This subproject builds a program to demonstrate use of EWS.
The Makefile will also build PDF documentation; this depends on an
installation of LaTeX (e.g. TeX Live).
