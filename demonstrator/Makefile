# Makefile for EWS demonstration.

# For Alire puroses, only the demo_code target applies; it's called in
# a pre-build action, while the actual build is done by alr
# build. This is needed because
#
# - the actual GPR is created by nuweb from ews.py
# - Alire needs a GPR (here, and by default, demonstrator.gpr)
# - demonstrator.gpr is an aggregate project which calls up the generated
#   project.
